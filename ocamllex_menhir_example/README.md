# OCamlLex and Menhir Example

This shows how to build a OCaml project containing a library in [./lib/](./lib/) using OCamlLex and Menhir, a binary in [./bin/](./bin/) that uses the library and tests of the library in [./test/](./test/) using Buck 2.

## Buck 2 Targets

- `buck2 clean` - deletes all generated files (in the directory `./buck-out/v2/`).
- `buck2 targets //...` - lists all available targets, including all Opam packages. The packages have a prefix of `root//third-party`.
- `buck2 build //...` - builds all targets.
- `buck2 run //:bin` - run the generated executable. This is an alias for `buck2 run //bin:ocamllex_menhir_example`.
- `buck2 run //:test` - run the generated executable. This is an alias for `buck2 run //test:ocamllex_menhir_example`.

### Examples

List only the targets of `ocamllex_menhir_example`, without the Opam packages:

```text
> buck2 targets //lib: //bin: //test: //:
File changed: root//README.md
Build ID: 58742ba4-60db-418a-9d02-1439c7e4112f
Jobs completed: 2. Time elapsed: 0.0s.
root//:bin
root//:lib
root//:test
root//bin:ocamllex_menhir_example
root//lib:ocamllex_menhir_example
root//lib:ocamllex_menhir_example.mli
root//lib:ocamllex_menhir_example__
root//test:ocamllex_menhir_example
```

Run the generated executable:

```text
> buck2 run //:bin
File changed: root//README.md
Build ID: 4ff6fa61-4b10-4744-8d88-583a7894fd90
Jobs completed: 3. Time elapsed: 0.0s.
BUILD SUCCEEDED
Some examples:
1 + 2 * 5 = 11
1.486 - 2.5 / 0.123 = -18.839203252
let a = 5 in a / 3 = 1
let a = 4.0 - 5.2 in let b = a * 0.123 in let c = 5.6 in a + b + c = 4.2524
```

Run the tests:

```text
>  buck2 run //:test
File changed: root//README.md
Build ID: 3d781d47-672c-4f79-9810-13042b8641d2
Jobs completed: 3. Time elapsed: 0.0s.
BUILD SUCCEEDED

## Buck 2 Files

- [./.buckroot](./.buckroot) - this marks the directory as the root of the Buck 2 directories. In real examples you might want to put all your projects in subdirectories of the Buck 2 root directory. This is an empty file.
- [./.buckconfig](./.buckconfig) - Contains the configuration generated by `buck2 init --git`.
- [./toolchains/BUCK](./toolchains/BUCK) - The configuration of the toolchains to use. You always need C++ (`system_cxx_toolchain`) and  Python (`system_python_bootstrap_toolchain`). The OCaml tool chain is `system_ocaml_toolchain`.
- [./third-party/](./third-party/) - This directory contains all third party dependencies and their configuration, like Opam packages. In a bigger Buck 2 configuration you want to use one subdirectory for each language or for each project, e.g. `third-party/ocaml` for all OCaml project dependencies or `third-party/basic-example` for the dependencies of `ocamllex_menhir_example`, if for example Opam package versions differ from project to project.
- [./third-party/BUCK](./third-party/BUCK) - The configuration of the Opam packages. Generated by the `ocaml-script` `dromedary.py`, and should not be edited manually.
- [./BUCK](./BUCK) - The main Buck 2 configuration file. Contains shorter aliases for the `bin` and `test` targets.
- [./bin/BUCK](./bin/BUCK) - The rules to build the binary.
- [./lib/BUCK](./lib/BUCK) - The rules to build the library.
- [./test/BUCK](./test/BUCK) - The rules to build the test.
- [./prelude/](./prelude/) - Contains all toolchains and rules for all supported languages of Buck 2. A Git submodule.
